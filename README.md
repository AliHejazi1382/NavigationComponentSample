# NavigationComponentSample

### Introducing
[Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) is a part of [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) in Android.

Navigation Components allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app

### Problem
Consider an app that has a [Bottm Navigation View](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomnavigation/BottomNavigationView).

You can navigate in each item of that. but it is important that we should handle back stack.

### Solution
I have prepared a source code for you with which you can easily handle the back stack of any item.

In this case I use these items:

- [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)
- [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
